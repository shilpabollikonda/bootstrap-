                  <h2>Web Development </h2>
                  <p>This course is designed to start you on a path toward future studies in web development and design,
                    no matter how little experience or technical knowledge you currently have. The web is a very big place,
                     and if you are the typical internet user, you probably visit several websites every day, whether for business,
                      entertainment or education.<br>
                      Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet
                       (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to
                        complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to
                         which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client
                          liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce 
                          development.<br>
                         Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites:
                          writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes
                           easier and available with basic technical skills.<br>

  <p>A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a clientâ€“server model. 
  The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, 
  Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web developer may
   specialize in client-side applications (front-end developer), server-side applications (back-end developer),
    or both (full-stack developer). </p>

    <p>There are no formal educational or license requirements to become a web developer. However, many colleges and trade schools 
      offer coursework in web development. There are also many tutorials and articles which teach web development, often freely 
      available on the web - for example, on JavaScript.

      Even though there are no formal requirements, web development projects require web developers to have advanced knowledge and 
      skills such as:
      
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript[1]
      Server/client side architecture like all or some of the above mentioned
      Programming/coding/scripting in one of the many server-side languages or frameworks (e.g., Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, Java, 
      ASP.NET, Node.js)
      Ability to utilize a database
      Creating single page application with the use of front-end tools such as Vue,[2] React.js[3] or Angular[4]
      
      <p>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to web design and web development, two very related
       fields:

      <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas 
      of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardized code and proprietary software; user
       experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the 
       design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term web design is normally used to describe the design 
       process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web 
       engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their 
       role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.
      
      <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network)
      .[2] Web development [3]can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet
       applications (web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web
        development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server
        -side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

        <p>Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup 
        and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic
         technical skills.

        <p>For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow 
        standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent 
        or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems 
        technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department.
         There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3] 
         Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with
          the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web with Tim Berners-Lee[4] developing the World Wide Web at CERN, the
           industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.

           <p>Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, 
           and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website.[1][2][3][4]

Tools used for front-end development
<p>There are several tools and platforms, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, available that can be used to develop the front end of a
 website.[5]

 <h3>HyperText Markup Language</h3>
  <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the backbone of any website development process, without which a web page does not exist. Hypertext
 means that text has links, termed hyperlinks, embedded in it. When a user clicks on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink, it will
  bring another web-page. A markup language indicates text can be turned into images, tables, links, and other representations. It is
   the HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site will look. HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee. The latest version
    of HTML is called HTML5 and was published on October 28, 2014 by the W3C recommendation. This version contains new and efficient 
    ways of handling elements such as video and audio files.

    <h3>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h3>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) controls the presentation aspect of the site and allows your site to have its own unique look. It does
 this by maintaining style sheets that sit on top of other style rules and are triggered based on other inputs, such as device screen 
 size and resolution. The CSS can be added externally, internally, or embedded in the HTML tags.[6]

<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming language (as opposed to HTML's declarative language model) that is used to
 transform
 a static HTML page into a dynamic interface. JavaScript code can use the Document Object Model (DOM), provided by the HTML standard,
  to manipulate a web page in response to events, like user input.

  <p>Using a technique called AJAX, JavaScript code can also actively retrieve content from the web (independent of the original HTML page 
retrieval), and also react to server-side events as well, adding a truly dynamic nature to the web page experience.

<h3>WebAssembly</h3>
<p>WebAssembly, supported by all the major browsers (i.e. from the major vendors Google, Apple, Mozilla and Microsoft), is the only 
alternative to JavaScript for running code in web browsers (without the help of plug-ins, such as Flash, Java or Silverlight; all being
 discontinued, as browsers are dropping plug-in support). Prior to its adoption, there was asm.js (a subset of JavaScript; and thus s
 trictly works in all browsers), that's also used as a compiler target with efficient support in browsers such as Internet Explorer 
 11; and for such browsers that do not support WebAssembly directly, it can be compiled to asm.js and those browsers supported that 
 way. Generally speaking programmers do not program in WebAssembly (or asm.js) directly, but use languages such as Rust, C or C++ or 
 in theory any language, that compile to it.
